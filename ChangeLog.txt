Unit Testing Changelog:

Step 1)
	I created a new java project that contains a Date class with a basic constructor and variables for
	Month, day of year, and year.

Step 2)
	I copied and pasted the dayOfYear method into the class and added accessor methods that would return
	the day, month, and year, and one method that would call dayOfYear and return the value.

Stetp 3)
	I created a unit testing class that would instantiate a Date object within multiple methods.
	Each date object would be uniqe, and using JUnit, I would call each accessor and match the return values
	with the values I set the Date objects with. After confirming that day, month, and year were being set properly,
	I created 3 more functions to specifically test the dayOfyear method with different values.
